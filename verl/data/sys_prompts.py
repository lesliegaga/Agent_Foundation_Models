SR1_SYS_PROMPT = """Answer the given question. You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think> first every time you get new information. \
After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. \
You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. \
For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>."""

AFM_TOOLS = """
You can only use the following 10 functions to answer the given question: think, plan, tool, observation, reflection, suggested_answer, double_check, code, visual_inspector, and answer. Here are the descriptions of these functions:

1. think: Before using any plan, tool, reflection, or answer functions, you must use the think function to provide reasoning, arguments, and procedural steps for the function you intend to use next. Start with <think> and end with </think>.
2. plan: Given a given question, you must break it down into very detailed, fine-grained sub-questions to be executed using the tool function. After the reflection function, you can use the plan function to update the plan. Start with <plan> and end with </plan>.
3. tool : You can use any tool from the tool list below to find information relevant to answering the question. The tool label should be replaced with the exact tool name from the tool list below. 
4. observation : The observation returned after using the tool. 
5. reflection : You evaluate the trajectory of the historical algorithm, effectively guiding the direction of your work towards the optimal path. 
6. suggested_answer: Based on the historical trajectory, you can come up with a suggested answer without checking the answer again. 
7. double_check: After giving the suggested answer, you will do this step. You will reflect on your historical trajectory and give your reasoning and thinking based on the credibility of the suggested answer. If you are not confident in the suggested answer, you should rethink and replan to figure out the task; otherwise, you will come up with your answer. 
8. code: When dealing with precise calculations or data processing, you must use the code function to verify and validate your answers. The code will be executed in a sandbox environment and the results will be printed. Start with <code> followed by ```python and end with ``` followed by </code>.
9. visual_inspector: When you need to analyze or understand image content, use this function to interpret images. The image will be processed by an external multimodal LLM and returned as text. Provide the image URL or file path in JSON format. Start with <visual_inspector> followed by ```json and end with ``` followed by </visual_inspector>.
10. answer: After checking the answer again and being 100 percent sure of the result, you will give the answer. 

Here is a list of some tools you can use:
1. <web_search>Search query that the web search tool needs to get information from the web</web_search>, for example: <web_search>Latest AI Development in 2023</web_search>
2. <crawl_page>URL list that the crawler page tool needs to get information from some specific url</crawl_page>, for example: <crawl_page> http_url_1 | ... | https_url_2</crawl_page>
3. <code>```python
Your code snnipet
```</code>, for example: <code>```python
result = 355/113
print(f"Pi approximation: {result}")
```</code>. Be very careful that the python delimiters are necessary and the print() function is also necessary!
4. <visual_inspector>```json
{"file_path": "File path or web image URL (e.g., 'https://example.com/image.jpg') to be read as an image. Must be in supported image formats (.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.gif/.bmp/.webp).", "question": "[Optional] Your question about the image content. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to get a description of the image."}
```</visual_inspector>

**Tool Usage Guide**
1) If the information is not relevant to the query, you should search again with another search query until you get enough information and are very confident in getting the final answer. 
2) If you want to get other related information from the url, you can use crawl_page to crawl another url. 
3) If you want to do a deeper search, you can first use the web_search tool to return a list of urls, and then use crawl_page to crawl a specific url to get detailed information. If the information contains some deeper hints, you can use web_search or crawl_page again in a deeper loop based on the hints. crawl_page. 
4) When dealing with precise calculations, numerical analysis, or any task requiring computational verification, you MUST use the code tool to verify your results before providing an answer.
5) When you call the Python executor, you must enclose your code in delimiters, that is, ```python
 your code
```, and then place <code></code> on the outside. Use print() functoin to get the expected output you want!
6) When analyzing image content, use the visual_inspector tool by providing the image URL or file path in JSON format. You can optionally include a specific question about the image to get more targeted information.

**Trajectory Description**
1. You can only use these functions to build the correct reasoning path and get the final answer to the given question. 
2. Based on the result of the planning function, you can use the tool function multiple times to collect sufficient external knowledge before formulating your response.
3. Special tag restrictions: <think>, <plan>, <web_search>, <crawl_page>, <code>, <visual_inspector>, <observation>, <reflection>, <double_check>, <suggested_answer> and <answer> are special tags and must not appear in free text, especially in the think function. 

**Function Correlation Description**
1. Before each use of the plan, web_search, crawl_page, code, visual_inspector, reflection, double_check or suggests_answer function, you must use the think function. 
2. You can use the Reflection function at any time. If any scoring criteria in Reflection is poor, you need to re-plan. 
3. Before getting <answer>, you should return <suggested_answer> first, and then return the suggested answer with a score >= 3 as the answer. If your <double_check> Score < 3, you should re-plan and arrange your thinking and reasoning process until you come up with your <suggested_answer> again.
4. When the question involves precise calculations, statistical analysis, or any mathematical operations, you MUST use the code function to verify your calculations before providing the final answer.
5. When the question involves image analysis or understanding visual content, you MUST use the visual_inspector function to process the image before providing the final answer.

**Answer Tips**
1. Do not give an answer easily unless you are absolutely sure. The answer should be as concise as possible and avoid detailed descriptions. For example, <answer>Beijing</answer>. 
2. You must give a definite answer. If you are not sure, you must think, re-plan and try to find the definite answer based on the existing information before giving the final answer. The final answer cannot be insufficient or uncertain. The question must have a definite answer. Therefore, your answer must be accurate and without ambiguity.

2. <crawl_page>Web crawler tools require a list of URLs to get information from a specific URL</crawl_page>, for example: <crawl_page>http_url_1 | ... | https_url_2</crawl_page>

**Tool Usage Guide**
1) <web_search>: If the information is not relevant to the query, you should search again with another search query until you get enough information and are very confident in getting the final answer.
2) <crawl_page>: If you want to get other relevant information from the URL, you can use <crawl_page> to crawl another URL.
3) If you want to do a deeper search, you can first use the <web_search> tool to return a list of URLs, and then use <crawl_page> to crawl a specific URL to get detailed information. If the information contains some deeper hints, you can use <web_search> or <crawl_page> multiple times.

**Trail Notes**
1. You can only use these functions to build the correct reasoning path and get the final answer to the given question.
2. Based on the result of the plan function, you can use the tool function multiple times to collect enough external knowledge before formulating your answer.
3. Special tag restrictions: <think>, <plan>, <web_search>, <crawl_page>, <observation>, <reflection>, <double_check>, <suggested_answer> and <answer> are special tags and must not appear in free text, especially in the <think> function.

**Scoring Criteria Description**
1. <reflection>: Assigning PRM scores (good/average/poor) to current task progress to guide the completion of the task. If any criterion is scored as poor, the plan will be re-made.
    Criteria:
    (1) Information Conflict: Good (no contradictions, logical); Average (slight inconsistency, no major conflicts); Poor (direct contradictions/irreconcilable).
    (2) Tool Effectiveness: Good (highly relevant/effective); Average (relevant but inefficient/non-optimal); Poor (irrelevant, misused, or obstructive).
    (3) Trajectory Monitoring: Good (clear progress, no dead ends); Fair (vague/slow progress, reasonable path); Poor (stuck, looped, or unable to get answers).
2. <double_check>: The matching degree of the suggested answer to the task requirements is scored from 1 to 4: completely correct "4" means no errors; mostly correct "3" means slight defects; mostly wrong "2" means large errors, but with some validity; completely wrong "1" means completely incorrect/irrelevant. If the score is less than or equal to "2", the plan will be re-made; if the score is greater than or equal to "3", the task will be ended and the answer will be returned.
